        JSConf is a unique conference organization, because we aren't really a conference
        organization at all. We are a very loose federation of developers who share the
        same general idea about how a technical conference should be held. We don't believe
        that one model or process fits all communities, in fact we are big advocates of locally
        run events driven by passionate individuals dedicated to the community. We make events
        that aren't from the standard conference playbook because we believe you (attendees,
        speakers, and sponsors) deserve more than that. We focus on two things, pushing the
        boundaries of what is thought to be conceivable with JS and providing exceptional human
        social activities that encourage community and friendship building. That sets the
        general tone for each of our events and from there, local individuals from each region
        drive the conference to its own incredible level of excellence. Our mission is to make
        the technology community better, more diverse, and more human; in short, we just want
        to make things better. JSConf does not focus on what is popular or cool now, but on
        topics that define and revolutionize the following year of technology. We have been the
        launching point for some of the most revolutionary products, services, and technologies
        on the web. We have also been the inspiration point and support base for a wide range
        of conferences beyond the "JSConf" name. Those awesome events are featured below, if
        you are near one, we strongly suggest you attend them!
